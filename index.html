Hi! My name is Jamie and I am PhD candidate at the University of Oregon in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution. When I am not doing research, you can catch me with my best friend and dog, Lim√≥n - where we both enjoy long walks through the park. 

Besides hanging with my buddy, I enjoy handcrafting miscellaneous things and working my way through the Silver Spoon cookbook.
