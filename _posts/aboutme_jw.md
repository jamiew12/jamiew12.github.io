Hi! My name is Jamie and I am PhD candidate at the University of Oregon
in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution. When I am not doing research,
you can catch me with my best friend and dog, Lim√≥n - where we both
enjoy long walks through the park.

Besides hanging with my buddy, I enjoy handcrafting miscellaneous things
and working my way through the Silver Spoon cookbook.
