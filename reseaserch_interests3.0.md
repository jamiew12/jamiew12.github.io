# Ecosytem Ecology

> I would broadly describe myself as an ecosystem ecologist because I am
> interested in studying the intersection of long-term climatic change
> and modern disturbances and how these consequently influence ecosystem
> function, specifically looking through the lens of soil carbon. I
> attempt to elucidate my research queries through predominantly
> utilizing principles of soil biogeochemistry.

## Soil Biogeochemistry

> When referring to soil biogeochemistry, I measure the following;

-   Carbon (total, mineral associated, pyrogenic)
-   Nitrogen
-   pH
-   Texture
-   Microbial composition (ASV data)
-   Elemental composition (Fluorine - Uranium)

> To quantify these measurements, I use some of the following
> instruments;

-   Costech Elemental Combustion System 4010
-   Handheld XRF Spectrometer

## Science Communication

> When I was five years old, my mother made the milestone of becoming
> the first college graduate in my family. However, once it was my turn
> to think about college, I was uncertain if that would be the right fit
> for me. Against my trepidation, I decided to go - and surprisingly, I
> enjoyed taking courses and following a path I curated. I was so fond
> of higher education that I ultimately decided to pursue a graduate
> degree. But once in graduate school, I began feeling unsettled. I was
> interacting with other academics, attempting to conjure novel
> hypotheses, and reading journal articles that completely stumped me.
> Needless to say, the impostor syndrome was making a comfortable home
> in my head. I just felt that so many variables I came across were
> designed to be confusing and jargon rich - even the pictures didn’t
> help! That was when I came to the realization of the scientist I
> wanted to be. I wanted the research I executed and shared to be
> digestible. I didn’t just want my data to be understandable to
> individuals outside of my niche research field, but to people beyond
> the realm of academia. I was unsure how to achieve this - but then it
> happened - an advanced cartography course offered and my fate was
> sealed. I realized the minute details and artistic edge that create
> science clarity, I was hooked.

> My career goals encompass working at the interface of research,
> science communication and management application. The first step to
> achieving this goal is through first learning how to share my research
> in ways that anyone could understand and I will achieve this through
> data visualization.
