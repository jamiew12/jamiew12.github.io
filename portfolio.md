## Publication Figures

![](/assets/img/StudyRegion_9.29.20.png) &gt; This figure was from a
journal article I co-authored (<https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15382>),
where we visualize the study region. The figure caption is the
following;

> “FIGURE 1 Study sites, current ecosystems, and climate: (a) mean
> annual precipitation (mm) over the time period 1981–2010. Blue stars
> indicate cave sites where paleoclimate records were derived from
> speleothems. (b) Mean annual temperature (℃) over the time period
> 1981–2010. (c) Study region displaying 83 sites sampled for this study
> within the Amazon–Cerrado region. The yellow line within the study
> region delineates the ecoregions—Amazon to the Northwest and Cerrado
> to the Southeast. Shapes and colors correspond to forest, savanna, or
> forest–savanna transitions. Climate map adapted from INMET (2019)”

> This figure was from a journal article I co-authored
> (<https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15382>), where we display how raw soil
> carbon isotopic data changes with depth. The figure caption is the
> following;

> “FIGURE 4 Soil organic matter carbon isotope ratios (δ13CSOM) across
> depths for (a) forest, (b) savanna, and (c) forest–savanna
> transitions. Figures to the right show the proportion of data points
> for each soil depth. Grey lines represent significant linear
> regressions (p &lt; .05) between soil depth and δ13CSOM within each
> soil profile. Red-dashed lines indicate the depth of 80 cm selected
> for vegetation reconstructions across all sites. Black points
> represent averages per depth. The majority of regressions indicate
> increasing woody cover over time”

> This figure was from a journal article I co-authored
> (<https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15382>), where soil carbon isotopic data
> was utilized as a proxy for vegetation change and strontium data was
> used as a proxy for climate (data from collaborators). The figure
> caption is the following;

> “FIGURE 5 Changes in δ13CSOM at (a) varying depths across study sites,
> where the x-axis is longitude and the y-axis is latitude, and depth
> has been converted to age; (b) vegetation change heatmap where blue
> represents woody vegetation expansion, yellow represents no change,
> and red represents grass expansion; and (c) strontium isotope ratios,
> adapted from Ward et al. (2019), as a proxy for soil moisture and rock
> dissolution, indicating a shift towards wetter conditions. Different
> colors within each location represent different speleothem samples
> collected within the same cave site (Figure 1)”

> This figure was from a journal article I co-authored
> (<https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15382>), which displays soil carbon
> trends across different ecosystem types. The figure caption is the
> following;

> “FIGURE6 Variation in soil organic carbon stocks for each ecosystem
> and soil depth (a). Small differences were found for average carbon
> stocks across ecosystems, although notable outliers exist within
> forests and forest–savanna transitions (b). A mixed-effects model
> indicates that soil order and woody vegetation expansion significantly
> affected soil carbon content only in savannas, where woody vegetation
> expansion had a positive effect on carbon stocks, with a significant
> random effect of sampling location for all ecosystem types (c)”
